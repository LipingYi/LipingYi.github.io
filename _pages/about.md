<!--I'm Liping Yi, a PhD student in the College of Computer at Nankai University, working with Prof. Gang Wang.
I have been a visiting scholar in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. Han Yu.
Prior to NKU, I received bachelor degree from Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2019.-->

I'm Liping Yi, a Tenure-Track Associate Professor, Master's Supervisor at the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University. 
I joined the [Machine Learning and Data Mining Laboratory](https://ml-dm-tju.pages.dev/) in June 2025, led by Prof. [Qinghua Hu](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/huqinghua/index.html).
I received my Ph.D. in June 2025 from the College of Computer Science, Nankai University, under the supervision of Prof. [Gang Wang](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548871/page.htm) and Prof. [Xiaoguang Liu](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548878/page.htm).
From December 2023 to November 2024, I conducted a Ph.D. joint research program in the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with Prof. [Han Yu](https://federated-learning.org/han.yu/). 
My research interests lie in federated learning and large-model multi-agent systems, with a focus on key challenges such as model heterogeneity, communication efficiency, personalized modeling, and system fairness.
I have published over 20 research papers in top-tier international journals and conferences, including IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, ICDE, NeurIPS, ICML, ICCV, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM and etc.
I have also been invited to serve as a reviewer for CCF-A conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and etc.
I have led multiple research projects, including the “CAST Young Talent Support Project (Doctoral Program)” funded by the China Association for Science and Technology.
