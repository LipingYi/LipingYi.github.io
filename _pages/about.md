<!--I'm Liping Yi, a PhD student in the College of Computer at Nankai University, working with Prof. Gang Wang.
I have been a visiting scholar in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. Han Yu.
Prior to NKU, I received bachelor degree from Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2019.-->

Liping Yi is a Tenure-Track Associate Professor, Master's Supervisor at the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University. 
She joined the [Machine Learning and Data Mining Laboratory](https://ml-dm-tju.pages.dev/) in June 2025, led by Prof. [Qinghua Hu](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/huqinghua/index.html).
She received her Ph.D. in the College of Computer Science from Nankai University in June 2025, working with Prof. [Gang Wang](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548871/page.htm) and Prof. [Xiaoguang Liu](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548878/page.htm). 
From December 2023 to November 2024, she conducted a Ph.D. joint research program in the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with Prof. [Han Yu](https://federated-learning.org/han.yu/). 
Her research interests lie in federated learning and large-model multi-agent systems, with a focus on key challenges such as model heterogeneity, communication efficiency, personalized modeling, and system fairness.
She has published over 20 research papers in top-tier international journals and conferences, including IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, ICDE, NeurIPS, ICML, ICCV, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM and etc.
She has also been invited to serve as a reviewer for CCF-A conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and etc.
She has led multiple research projects, including the “CAST Young Talent Support Project (Doctoral Program)” funded by the China Association for Science and Technology.
