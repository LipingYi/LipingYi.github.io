I'm Liping Yi, a PhD student in College of Computer at Nankai University, working with Prof. Gang Wang. Prior to NKU, I received undergraduate degrees in Internet of Things Engineering from Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2019.

Iâ€™m interested in tackling challenging issues in Federated Learning, such as 
 robustness to adversarial attacks, communication efficiency, personalization for boosting accuracy, and support for heterogeneous models.
