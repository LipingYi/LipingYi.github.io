I'm Liping Yi, a PhD student in College of Computer at Nankai University, working with Prof. Gang Wang. Prior to NKU, I received undergraduate degrees in Internet of Things Engineering from Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2019.

I’m interested in tackling challenging issues in Federated Learning, such as robustness to adversarial attacks, communication efficiency, personalization for boosting accuracy, and support for heterogeneous models.
